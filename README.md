Version 1.0
Made in Port Harcourt 
The Web App is a PWA, Progressive Web Apps like "Disciplin" can be installed as a standalone app on the user device, just like mobile apps.
Disciplin is a "GitHub" powered offline PWA, this means it can also be accessible offline if the user has installed the app as shown on the top right corner.
Each day, the user should log an entry of how the previous day went in the "log activity" tab and that will be saved in the "history tab", the user can only log one entry per day, to log another entry on same day, the user will have to delete the previous entry.
The app keeps record of your "clean days" and restarts the streak if you relapsed.
The app stores the data locally on your browser cache, this means if you clear caches at some point, you will automatically clear your entries(if any) on the web app
The App "Disciplin" does not collect or store any user data whether offline or online, all "entries" are saved on the device used to access the app.
The app does not track user browsing behaviour nor does it enable site cookies, it's a totally privacy enabled web app.
